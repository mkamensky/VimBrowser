* Version 0.3

Bug fixes:
	- Solved encoding problems (as much as can be done - see 
	  README.encoding)
	- Formatting did not behave correctly for markup that had no _start 
	  and _end settings. Now fixed
	- On windows, the buffer name can not contain ?, which broke things 
	  for uris that contain it. Fixed.
	- Ignored the Content-Disposition header field. As a result, 
	  attachments (such as script files on vim.sf.net)
	- require new enough versions of modules (HTTP::Cookies >= 1.36, 
	  HTML::Form >= 1.038)
	- POST requests did not follow redirections because of 
	  mis-configuration of the user agent.
	- link boundaries where calculated incorrectly in some cases.
	- various other minor bugs.

Other changes:
	- added a mapping of <C-R> to reload the current page
	- improved vimbrowse.pl to have more chance of working on windows
	- added some more functionality to Vim.pm
	- setting most options now has effect also after loading the plugin
	
* Version 0.2

Main Improvements:
	- Added forms support. All input kinds are supported except for 
	  textarea, file and multiple choice options. Thus, eg, google can be 
	  used
	- Made less system dependent. No known system dependent parts remain.  
	  Most features should now work on any platform. Partially tested on 
	  windows, thanks to Suresh Govindachar.
	- A command line (perl) script, 'vimbrowse.pl', now allows lunching 
	  vim as a browser from the command line.
	- Numerous bugs were fixed.

Incompatible changes:
	- All the plugin's related data is now kept in one directory, 
	  specified by g:browser_data_dir. In particular, if 
	  g:browser_addrbook_dir is not explicitly set, the bookmarks 
	  directory now resides in that directory.
	- The default command names were changed to contain the prefix 
	  'Browser', to reduce the risk of incompatibility with other plugins.  
	  The original (shorter) commands can be restored by installing 
	  plugin/browser_short.vim from the 'extra' directory.
