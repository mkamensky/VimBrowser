* Version 1.1 (Tue 15 Mar 2005 10:48:51 AM IST)

Main Improvements:
	- Added the uri history://n to access the n-th newest item in the 
	  history. Similarly, the :History command may now accecpt a numeric 
	  argument.
	- The last access time for each link now appears on the history page
	- Added the g:browser_connect_timeout variable to control when we give 
	  up connecting to a remote site
	- Added support for homepage in the plugin. :Browse and similar 
	  commands can now be called with no arguments.
	- Changed the loading of the plugin so that vim startup time is 
	  improved.
	- Added a command for showing the current mappings, and a command to 
	  extend this list for user defined mappings
	- Improved documentation and added the html version.

Main code changes
	- Changed cite markup to use synmark
	- Using UTF-8 for all files
	- Use the new decoded_content of HTTP::Response (when available)
	- adapted for vim 7 (refrain from wiping out the extra buffer that was 
	  created when using :file)
	- use the browsedir() vim function in Vim::browse()

Other changes:
	- added explanation when content decoding fails
	- show progress and uri on the status line (in fact, it's just the 
	  debug output of LWP :)

* Version 1.0 (Sat 20 Nov 2004 10:55:30 PM IST)

Main Improvements:
	- Added a sidebar
	- The bookmarks can now be opened as browser pages
	- Added menu support (context menus and the toolbar)
	- Added support for opening content with external applications, 
	  through mailcap files
	- Added global history, viewable as a browser page
	- Modifications made to the page source are now reflected in the page
	- Added more commands for inline image handling
	- Scheme handlers can now be vim commands, as well as external 
	  programs.
	- Reviewed documentation, added a glossary

Main code changes
	- The conceal patch is no longer used. The browser depends on another 
	  plugin, synmark.vim, instead.
	- Added the Mailcap.pm perl module, to interface mailcap files, for 
	  running external application for content types not supported 
	  internally. Also added corresponding functions to Vim.pm
	- File related dialogs are now implemented using the browse() vim 
	  function.
	- vimbrowse.pl now opens vim in a terminal, rather than the gui one, 
	  unless called as 'gvimbrowse' or with the "--gui" option.

Other changes:
	- Added option to not break lines, so that the text width changes when 
	  resizing the vim window.
	- Added mapping for browsing based on the current uri
	- Frames are now (partially) supported
	- <CR> in text inputs in a form will submit that form.
	- Deal with compressed content, according to the content encoding.
	- The B<id> attribute of any html element can be used as a fragment
	- Added the possibility to add a bookmark of a page to any bookmarks 
	  file, without changing the default one.
	- Initial comments in a bookmarks file are now preserved.
	- Followed links now appear with a different highlighting
	- Added option to prevent the plugin from giving any messages.
	- The headers displayed by the :ShowHeader command are now displayed 
	  at the bottom of the page, rather than the top.

* Version 0.4

Main Improvements:
	- Improved and added searching commands: Added a special bookmarks 
	  file, _search, and commands :Search, :SearchUsing and :Keyword using 
	  it.
	- Encoding displayed correctly, without need to patch the (system 
	  wide) HTML::TreeBuilder.
	- Removed dependence of the HTML-Format bundle (now depends only on 
	  HTML-Tree).
	- The browser pages are not modifiable by default. This is safer, and 
	  looks much better with the conceal patch.
	- All input types are now supported (added file, textarea, and option 
	  with "multiple" attribute).
	- Added the possibility to save inline images.

Main code changes:
	- HTML::FormatText::Vim no longer depends on HTML::FormatText and on 
	  HTML::Formatter. The only dependancy is HTML::TreeBuilder (which is 
	  also a pre-requisit for HTML::Formatter), which appears to be much 
	  more widely available. The full explanation is in the 
	  HTML::FormatText::Vim pod.
	- Using a tiny derived class of HTML::TreeBuilder, 
	  HTML::TreeBuilder::Encode, to solve the encoding problems. This 
	  class is defined in HTML::FormatText::Vim.
	- VIM::Browser changes: moved much of the handling of fetching a new 
	  page from the page class to the main package (VIM::Browser). The 
	  %FORMAT hash now contains only formatting routines.

Other changes:
	- Added support for some extra tags: nobr, wbr, underline, dfn.
	- vimbrowse.pl should now finally work on windows.
	- :Reload now works correctly and prompts in case the page is a result 
	  of posting a form.
	- removed the few function descriptions that were available in the 
	  documentation.
	- The 'c' flag in the guioptions is taken into account, whenever 
	  possible.
	- Lots of bug fixes

* Version 0.3.1

Bug fix:
	form submission requests were not handled correctly.

* Version 0.3

Bug fixes:
	- Solved encoding problems (as much as can be done - see 
	  README.encoding)
	- Formatting did not behave correctly for markup that had no _start 
	  and _end settings. Now fixed
	- On windows, the buffer name can not contain ?, which broke things 
	  for uris that contain it. Fixed.
	- Ignored the Content-Disposition header field. As a result, 
	  attachments (such as script files on vim.sf.net)
	- require new enough versions of modules (HTTP::Cookies >= 1.36, 
	  HTML::Form >= 1.038)
	- POST requests did not follow redirections because of 
	  mis-configuration of the user agent.
	- link boundaries where calculated incorrectly in some cases.
	- various other minor bugs.

Other changes:
	- added a mapping of <C-R> to reload the current page
	- improved vimbrowse.pl to have more chance of working on windows
	- added some more functionality to Vim.pm
	- setting most options now has effect also after loading the plugin
	
* Version 0.2

Main Improvements:
	- Added forms support. All input kinds are supported except for 
	  textarea, file and multiple choice options. Thus, eg, google can be 
	  used
	- Made less system dependent. No known system dependent parts remain.  
	  Most features should now work on any platform. Partially tested on 
	  windows, thanks to Suresh Govindachar.
	- A command line (perl) script, 'vimbrowse.pl', now allows lunching 
	  vim as a browser from the command line.
	- Numerous bugs were fixed.

Incompatible changes:
	- All the plugin's related data is now kept in one directory, 
	  specified by g:browser_data_dir. In particular, if 
	  g:browser_addrbook_dir is not explicitly set, the bookmarks 
	  directory now resides in that directory.
	- The default command names were changed to contain the prefix 
	  'Browser', to reduce the risk of incompatibility with other plugins.  
	  The original (shorter) commands can be restored by installing 
	  plugin/browser_short.vim from the 'extra' directory.
