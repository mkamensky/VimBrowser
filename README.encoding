This file provides some guidelines for displaying web pages in  various 
encodings.

1. The perl version should be at least 5.8 (I think this is a requirement 
   disregarding the encoding issues, though)

2. It is best to work with 'encoding' set to utf-8. Other possibilities are 
   untested, probably won't work, and will anyway have problems with some web 
   pages.

3. Web pages are supposed to specify the encoding they use. Sometimes they 
   don't, sometimes they specify it incorrectly. The value of 
   g:browser_assumed_encoding is used when the encoding can not be deduced.  
   If you know the encoding, you might try setting the value of this variable 
   to it, and then reload the page.

4. If you see stuff like &#8222; instead of actual characters, you need to 
   re-install HTML::Parser. When installing it, answer 'y' to the question 
   about unicode entities (If you happen to be using Gentoo linux, you can 
   find a modified ebuild that does it on gentoo bugzilla).

5. If things are still not displayed correctly, it might be because of a bug 
   somewhere between HTML::Parser and perl. People seem to be aware of it, so 
   one day it will probably be fixed. Meanwhile, there is a workaround, but 
   it involves editing HTML::TreeBuilder: First, find its location. You can 
   do it by running
     
     perl -MHTML::TreeBuilder -e 'warn $INC{"HTML/TreeBuilder.pm"}'
   
   Edit that file, find the 'sub text {', and then the first line where 
   '$text' appears (in my version, which is 3.13, this is line 984).  
   Immediately after that line, add the following two lines:

    use Encode;
    $text = decode_utf8($text);

   This should make all problems disappear.

If you still see any encoding problems (as well as other problems), please 
report them, along with the page where it happened.
